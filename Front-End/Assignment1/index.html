            <h1>Best Practices in Web Development</h1><hr>
                <p>The best practice in web-development is follow the norms of industry 
                    it's simply saying you are develop for business so you must know how properly develop for the 
                    industry and they have a rule's and guidelinein industry.
                    like for example came from my source is imagine you have to build a race car.Would you prefer 
                    starting with a bare sheet of metal? Or would it be easier if you started with an existing frame that you could 
                    cut and weld to your liking?
                    It is correct Nowadays they are so many existing fremework the we can use to build web we can use to reduce unnecesarry errors and built a quality app.   
                </p>
            
            <h2>Start By Planning</h2>
                <p>In my my own expierience in college and in my Ojt we build app without plan and eventually we rewrite our code over and over again.
                    This is waste of time so we learn to this mistake. Imagine you are a engineering you have to create a blueprint and think and identify 
                    the overall project 
                    that you are going to folow the rest of the Project you are going to built      
                </p>
            <h2>Stick To The Standards</h2>
                <p> In this Step stick to the Standards if you are going to search in the web they are plenty of site that you can see and was created by so many great and talented developer and engineering
                    the best way of pratice stating those developer just follow how they built it or design it.and you can follow this industry norm for
                    in web development example There is an ‘ideal’ position for every feature, particularly on the homepage. While the company logo should be at the top-left corner of the homepage, contact information, 
                    organizational details, and registration options  
                </p>
            <h2>Code Smarter, Not Longer</h2>
                <p>Code smarter, Not longer this is what we must know before coding like me before, My code are so irritable and so annoying that you 
                    you can't unserstand what going on becuase i don't use comment in every line of my code what i learn if we are in a team we must need be more smarter 
                    creating our code that more understandable and avoid writing too complex that make our code hard to practice of inserting short, single-line notes throughout your code
                    for awareness of what happen and avoid bugs
                </p>
            <h2>Sprint, Don’t Leap</h2>
                <p>In this step I understand important of even if a little update whether it's minor change like fonts or introducing a new feature 
                    the trick i learned is to maintain a balance betwen today's demand and future inovation. the UI created today eventually got outdated for a long road 
                    Therefore, it’s imperative and develop the backend accordingly. 
                </p>
            <h2>Establish multi-device compatibility</h2>
                <p>This step you must know how to code in multiple paltform like google, firefox and the demand nowadays smartphone,iphone, tablet that easily to carry
                    so we need to built and app that compatible in multiple devices 
                </p>
